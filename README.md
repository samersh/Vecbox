# Vecbox
Palestine Hackerspace Repository

Vecbox is the first Palestinian Hackerspace in Ramallah, where Palestinian students/ young professionals and artists of all ages gather to share resources and knowledge, work on projects, network and build. The main focus of Vecbox is creating growth opportunities among the makers community in Palestine. Vecbox strives to be the go-to place for eager learner, where various expert advisors with IT backgrounds will be available as mentors and instructors. The makerspace - sometimes referred to as a hackerspace- will be mainly associated with fields such as hardware engineering prototypes such as providing 3D printing services, computer science such as programming and graphic design.This idea of a collaborative studio space for creative endeavors, where the informal combination of lab, shop, and conference room form a compelling argument for learning through hands-on exploration has proved its success in many technologically advanced nations. Here the Vecbox team, which is a group of Palestinian entrepreneurs seeking to deliver the Palestinian society to a global level of technological awareness and development, found their fuel. Bringing the know-how from international successful entrepreneurs and plant it in the rising generation of Palestinians is what keeps us going. Our team consists of several members of various backgrounds such as IT and computer science, graphic design, fine arts, business and marketing that pursue a better future for the Palestinian people which is only achievable when they are given a chance to unlock the technical issues that they face through technology.
